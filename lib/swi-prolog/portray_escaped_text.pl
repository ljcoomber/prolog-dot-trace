/** <module> Portray text

A Prolog string is a list of character-codes: (small) integers, which
results in output like this:

    ==
    ?- writeln("hello").
    [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
    ==

Unless you know the Unicode tables by   heart, this is pretty unpleasant
for debugging. Loading this library  makes   the  toplevel  and debugger
print strings with at least 3 characters  as "text ...". Of course, this
is an ambigious operation because nobody can know whether [65,66] should
be written as "AB" or a list: to  Prolog they are the same. Therefore it
is imported that the user  is  aware   of  the  fact that this heuristic
conversion  is  enabled.  This  is  why  this  library  must  be  loaded
explicitely to enable this conversion.

@tbd	Allow setting the character-codes we try to convert
